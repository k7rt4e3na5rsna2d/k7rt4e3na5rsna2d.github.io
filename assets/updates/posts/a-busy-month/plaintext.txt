Phew, it's been a busy month!

Take a look at a few things we've been up to

From ceiling lightboxes to large format graphics and Autumn window schemes, we've had a busy month working with some of the biggest names on the high-street.

Eye-catching displays

Visually stunning lightboxes help attract customers to key locations in your store.

We partnered with APS and created an eye-catching installation for Lacoste. The “Made For Her” campaign includes dynamic hexagon 3D plinth stands that we manufactured and installed.
