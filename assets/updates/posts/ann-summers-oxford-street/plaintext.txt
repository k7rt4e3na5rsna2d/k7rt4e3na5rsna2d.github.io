Tattoos, rabbits and super sexy displays

We team up with Ann Summers to create something exciting

When it comes to satisfying results, Ann Summers certainly know a thing or two. We teamed up with the iconic retailer to create a window and in-store display to get the heart pumping.

This is the first Ann Summers store to house a tattoo parlour in its basement, opened by renowned tattoo artist Dan Gold. What better way to promote it than with vibrant lightboxes. We advised on the fit, depth and size before lovingly manufacturing each one. 

A damn good flocking

We gave the Ann Summers rabbit (the one with the ears) a full blown makeover, with diamonds for eyes, rose gold whiskers and a soft-touch black flocked coat.

Rose gold is in vogue! We manufactured striking "erotic" wall lettering to join a larger-than-life mannequin cage, supplied and installed by our experts for a perfect match.

We designed a bespoke wall vinyl cage to complement its 3D counterpart, perfectly framing the mannequin. Our team reproduced Dan Gold's amazing tattoos so they could be worn by the mannequins themselves.

We loved being able to flex our creative muscles in designing, delivering and installing such a broad range of props, fixtures and graphics. Wall mounted product boxes join illuminated signage to set the scene. 

Free-standing display plinths enhance the set product, and tone-of-voice blocks reach out to the customer. Of course, our vinyl graphics, canvas frames and super lush Lux Display lightboxes round off the show.

It took just three days to install everything and we were thrilled that the display was well received.
