The unexpected happens. Your all-important Christmas windows and in-store display project suddenly takes a turn for the worse with an unforeseen problem. What if a supplier can't meet the order deadline, or a production run of 3D props looks worse than the prototype you approved months ago? Urgh!!! Maybe a critical fault was discovered in a lightbox destined for hundreds of stores nationwide and you need to find replacements, fast. Perhaps you're short on VM specialists or, dare we say, face the ultimate nightmare of urgently needing to roll out a totally different Christmas scheme altogether!
