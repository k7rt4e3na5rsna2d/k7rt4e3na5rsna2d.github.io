Taking the shopping experience to the next level

We team up with Missguided to deliver another fantastic new store

Missguided recently opened their second brick and mortar store – home to their official babe uniform – in Bluewater, Kent. This comes less than a year after the successful launch of the fashion brand’s inaugural flagship store in London’s Westfield Stratford City, further establishing it as a key player in the physical retail space. 

Here at Vision On we were once again excited to play a part in manufacturing and delivering key elements of the new experiential store, designed by leading creative agency Dalziel & Pow. From the fabulous 3D props to the elegant wall vinyl graphics, we couldn’t be prouder in contributing to Missguided’s amazing shopping experience. Our very own Lux Display team manufactured the eye-catching custom lightboxes that shine throughout the store, adding brilliance to the already engaging visually merchandised displays.

We applied fret-cut vinyl to mirror columns, evoking a great sense of depth. Large curved non-illuminated screens and a double-sided display highlight focal areas within the store. Pink tone-of-voice text blocks, mirror plinths and 3D pineapples in various sizes and coordinating colours were all lovingly produced and delivered by our team. 

Our project managers worked closely with the contractors on-site to ensure everything went smoothly. We believe direct communication is vital to the success of any project. From production to delivery, we completed the scheme in less than two months. We think the store looks amazing. Why not take a look?!
