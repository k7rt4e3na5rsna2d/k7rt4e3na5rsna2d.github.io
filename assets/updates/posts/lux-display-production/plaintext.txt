Hi, we’re Lux Display 

We’re part of Vision On Design and one of the UK’s leading lightbox manufacturers. As a global business we currently supply to the UK, Europe, America and Australia. 

Our precision engineered aluminium frames and tension fabric graphics enhance every space and bring it to life, whether that’s interiors or window displays.

Here at Lux Display we offer unrivalled, competitive pricing with an end-to-end service; from design and production to delivery and installation. We pride ourselves on offering an exceptional high quality service and product. 

Available in bespoke shapes and sizes to maximise the space, LED lightboxes are a very effective way of attracting maximum attention to promotions and advertising. 

Our dye-sublimation and UV print stretch fabric graphics are secured in position by silicone strips, which are ideal for quick and easy installation and refresh. All of which are designed and manufactured in-house, at Vision On Design’s factory in West Yorkshire.

Our lightboxes come in a variety of profile depths; slim-line 33mm, 55mm, 65mm and 100mm. So we’ll have a finish that suits your needs. You may also consider our non-illuminated variants in all profile depths, including a super-slim 15mm. 

We can help transform your space!
